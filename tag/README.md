Kampela NFC Tag is used as a Kampela companion for direct NFC communication with a phone, while Kampela remains be completely passive device minimizing the transmittion of any RF signal even not changing the NFC receiver quality factor to communicate with a user smartphone.

A nice bonus of this approach is that the tag is the second security factor - Kampela doesn't work without the correct tag to prevent simple attacks.

Kampela NFC Tag is also poured into a transparent enclosure to protect it from the harsh environment and silent modification.
